                      <br><b>Goal:</b>
                    Our goal during this case study was to gain insight from the perspectives of vehicle owners. Through candid interviews and usability tests, we were able to highlight shortcomings and needed improvements to the application from fresh, objective viewpoints. CARBAR’s trajectory as a product is attached to innovation that focuses on personalize vehicle security and safety.

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    (survey) To kick start off our research, we distributed an online survey to individuals that fit our target audience. We asked questions about their public parking experience, the occurrence of unknown vehicle damage and what protective measures they already take to ensure the safety of their vehicle. We collected a total of 13 survey responses, some of the key findings were as follows - 

                    (User interviews) Next, we conducted virtual user interviews to understand their needs and what their goals were regarding the safety of their vehicle. We begin this process by creating a user interview script/ protocol based on our research goals. We interviewed 5 participants that fit our target audience criteria.

                <h2>Design Concepts</h2>
                <p>
                    (Analyze data) From our user responses we then constructed an Affinity diagram using the affinity mapping technique where we discussed our findings while grouping them into categories. 

                    (Synthesis data) We also created an empathy map to get a better grasp of our overall user. In our empathy map we noted what our users had experienced such as hearing about the increase in break ins on the local news, feelings of being afraid or  unsafe, seeing other vehicles being damaged in in public garages, and safety measures such as parking under streetlights. After developing this empathy map, we constructed a user persona of our overall users. (We are quite sure that there are other user personas we could use but we just focused on this user in particular)                                                                                                                                                                                                                      (During the survey and interviews we discovered that vehicle owners seek to maintain vehicle safety in order to ensure a reliable solution to work and social events.
                    Therefore, we believe that security measures is a necessity as car owners and that we might be able to help if we bypass any of the unnecessary stress when it comes to communicating with insurance.
                    We might do this by providing simple features to users that act as preventative measures, as well as features that document incidents in order to provide a stress-free claim process.)
                    After having this insight, we begin looking into apps and similar trends that already existed in the market and from there created a Competitive Analysis.

                <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
                <p>
                    The competitive analysis helped us gain inspiration and also showed us what mistakes to avoid.  We then gathered around for a team ideation and brainstorming session. In this session we discussed Feature Prioritization, User Scenarios, Storyboards, and User Flows. For our Feature Prioritization Matrix, we used the I Like, I Wish, What If method. – That looked as follows

            <div class="section-content iterations">
                <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
                <p>
                    Our target users really enjoyed our concept, but they also uncovered some areas where the interface needed improvements to better excess our users’ experience. The key findings were as follows –
                    (Buttons too low, no back button, is there a place where my reported incidents are kept, why do I have to insert insurance and vehicle all the time- repetitiveness – minimize the steps for the user especially because most of these reports will come from high stress and emotional situations)

                    Having this understanding allowed us to make some adjustments to our low-fidelity design prompting us to move into our high-fidelity designs. In our high-fidelity phase we added visual layers bring our app concept to life. We kept in mind that majority of these reports will result from a high stressful and emotional situation, so we wanted to minimize the steps and use bigger buttons to make the design simpler and feel quick to navigate. Based on our style guide we developed the following screens –
